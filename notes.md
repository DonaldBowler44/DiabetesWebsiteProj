    -Have non-alocholic fatty liver disease
    -Do not have a healthy diet

-create a percentage calculator to handle the math functions for the associated risk of disease (you can use vanilla JS or try to find a library)

-have display button and an associated display function that shows the associated results of calculated risk

example project:

https://metscalc.org/

-This is a healthcare app, designed for previsit diagnosis, aimed to help people decide on the severity of their healthcare condition and whether or not they should go to a doctor

-"How were these MetS scores formulated?
The MetS z-score was not calculated directly similar to other z-scores (BMI z-scores used for children, etc.). Rather, it was derived from a type of analysis (called a confirmatory factor analysis) that examines how the various components of MetS (obesity, blood pressure, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and fasting blood sugar) are correlated with one another. This analysis also allowed for the correlations between the MetS components to be different by sex and race/ethnicity. This analysis allows us to produce a score that quantifies the value of this MetS latent factor for an individual based on the individualâ€™s measurements of those components. This score behaves like a z-score, in that it has a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation equals 1. It was derived from a nationally representative sample of the U.S. population (from NHANES).

What variables are used for calculating the severity score?
The score requires information regarding the five components of the metabolic syndrome. These are systolic blood pressure (the upper number of the two numbers given in a blood pressure), triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, glucose (or blood sugar), and a measure of weight status. The most common means of measuring weight status is body mass index, which is calculated from height and weight. Body weight status can also be measured from waist circumference. Either of these measures of body weight status can be used in calculating a metabolic syndrome severity score."
